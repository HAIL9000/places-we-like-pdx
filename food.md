## Places to Eat

### Obon Shokudo | [website](https://www.obonpdx.com/)
`vegan`, `japanese`

Tasty Japanese vegan food, includes everything from curry udon to okonomiyaki to onigiri. The combo plate is excellent and a great way to sample a lot of their best offerings, highly reccomend the "unseemly" onigir which is deep fried (makes the rice crispy on the outside, soft on the inside).

### FOMO Chicken | [website](http://www.fomochicken.com/home)
`korean`, `fried-chicken`

Great Korean style fried chicken, the spicy and sweet options are both killer. Also includes American style fried food too, fried pickles, fried chicken sando, etc.

### Scottie's Pizza | [website](https://www.scottiespizzaparlor.com/)

Amazing pizza place that supports their workers. They aren't doing half-and-half pizzas during Covid but The #1 in particular is amazing.

### JoJo | [website](https://jojopdx.com/)

Delicious fried chicken cart featuring tasty sandwiches, chicken tenders, good sauces and excellent jojos.

Incredibly tasty fast-food style burgers, great fries and shakes also. They have a vegan option for the burger but we haven't tried it.

### Kati | [website](https://www.katiportland.com/)
`thai`, `vegan`

Really good vegetarian/vegan thai food. The Boss Special and their Pad Thai are excellent, but everything we've tried there has been great. Good cooktails and non-alcoholic drinks too, Hailee loves the Thai Green Tea.

`mexican`, `burritos`

In terms of food carts, they have good burritos and a few locations around town. Not particularlly standout but pretty tasty for a quick burrito.

Amazing hand-pulled noodles and some other good dishes including the bulgogi fries which are super tasty (french fries topped with bulgogi, cheese, and sweet sauce, so good!)

## Places to Eat

### Obon Shokudo | [website](https://www.obonpdx.com/)
`vegan`, `japanese`
#### Description: 
Tasty Japanese vegan food, includes everything from curry udon to okonomiyaki to onigiri. The combo plate is excellent and a great way to sample a lot of their best offerings, highly reccomend the "unseemly" onigir which is deep fried (makes the rice crispy on the outside, soft on the inside).

### FOMO Chicken | [website](http://www.fomochicken.com/home)
`korean`, `fried-chicken`
### Description:
Great Korean style fried chicken, the spicy and sweet options are both killer. Also includes American style fried food too, fried pickles, fried chicken sando, etc.

## Places to Eat

### Obon Shokudo | [website](https://www.obonpdx.com/)
`vegan`, `japanese`
#### Description: 
Tasty Japanese vegan food, includes everything from curry udon to okonomiyaki to onigiri. The combo plate is excellent and a great way to sample a lot of their best offerings, highly reccomend the "unseemly" onigir which is deep fried (makes the rice crispy on the outside, soft on the inside).

## Places to Drink

### Upper Left | [website](https://upperleftroasters.com/)
`coffee`, `roaster`, `brunch`

Delicious coffee, Lilah likes the Spice Au Lait and Hailee likes their seasonal Cafe de Olla. They also have a great selection of food for brunch including a wide variety of toasts which are all great. Suggest the Romesco and the Turkish Eggs.

### Water Avenue Coffee | [website](https://wateravenuecoffee.com/)
`coffee`, `roster`, `brunch`

Excellent coffee with good seasonal drinks. The breakfast is also pretty decent. They also have a pretty good selection of non-coffee drinks (e.g. nice tea lattes) and you can get a fancy s'mores latte with a big marshmallow.

### Roseline Coffee | [website](https://roselinecoffee.com/)

Excellent coffee with automated pourover machines, great pastries (esp. scones), and their sandwiches are good too.

Pretty good coffee, several locations, and the people are nice!

`coffee`, `roaster`

Great coffee, especially their selection of fancy flavored lattes, and good beans too. We have been finding it quite crowded lately though, especially on weekends.
